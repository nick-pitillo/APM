    Luis Martinez was born in Havana, Cuba, before emigrating to Miami as a young child. While studying at Johnson & Wales University, he worked in restaurants around the world, eventually opening COMO Hotels in Miami Beach and training at Michelin-starred Ametsa with Arzak Instruction in London. It was there he discovered his true passion for wine service and hospitality.

    Returning to Miami, Luis worked under Michael Mina at Bourbon Steak before joining the opening team at Alter by Brad Kilgore in 2016. As General Manager and Sommelier, he became known for his inventive wine pairings, spotlighting small producers and innovative winemaking techniques. Under his leadership, Alterâ€™s wine program was named one of the Top 100 in America by Wine Enthusiast for several years.
